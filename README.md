## Description

1. Centralized governance prone to corruption and manipulation.
2. Lack of a decentralized database for securely storing complaints, leaving data vulnerable to unauthorized access and manipulation.
3. Issues raised exclusively shared with the government, excluding community visibility.
4. Lack of mechanisms to pressure the government to address Complaints
5. Absence of a Feedback Mechanism for Residents to provide suggestions & for the Government Authorities to Access Performance & Address Shortcomings. 

## Features
issueDAO offers the following features:
- **Decentralized Governance and Issue Resolution**<br>
  The DAO operates on a decentralized governance model where decisions are made collectively by its members.
Members can submit grievances, vote on issues, and provide feedback on government actions through transparent and immutable smart contracts deployed on a blockchain platform.
- **Token-Based Incentives and Penalties**<br>
  Active participation in voting, providing feedback, and addressing grievances is incentivized through token rewards.
Members receive tokens for their contributions, encouraging engagement and involvement in DAO activities.
Conversely, lack of participation in voting or failure to address grievances results in penalties, ensuring accountability and encouraging responsible governance.
- **Transparent and Immutable Database**<br>
  All grievances, updates, feedback, resolutions, and token transactions are recorded and stored in a decentralized database (Polybase).
The database ensures transparency, immutability, and accessibility to all members, facilitating trust and accountability within the DAO ecosystem.
Members can track the progress of grievances, view government actions and updates, and participate in the decision-making process with confidence in the integrity of the system.
- **Push Protocol for Community Discussion on Issues**<br>
  Members receive instant alerts on new grievances, government updates, and feedback, fostering timely engagement and participation.Facilitates prompt communication and feedback, expediting issue resolution and fostering effective governance.

## Working
The DApp involves two primary stakeholders: residents and government employees. Both have to verify themselves by connecting their wallet.

1. **DAO Membership**<br>
    Users can join the DAO by staking a certain amount of tokens and purchasing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) as part of the membership process.

2. **Voting Power**<br>
   Each member's voting power is determined by the number of tokens they hold. More tokens result in greater voting power during decision-making processes.
   
4. **Grievance Mechanism**<br>
    Members can post grievances or vote on grievances posted by others. Grievances could include complaints, suggestions for improvements, or requests for action on certain issues.

5. **Issue Resolution**<br>
   Grievances that receive more than 30% of votes are converted into official issues that the DAO government must address. 

6. **Government Actions**<br>
   The DAO government, consisting of elected or appointed representatives, is responsible for addressing the issues raised by members. They must provide updates on the progress and resolution of each issue.
Members can provide feedback on the government's updates.
Issues marked as resolved require 75% upvotes from members to confirm resolution.

7. **Token-Based Incentives**<br>
   Members receive token-based rewards for active participation in voting and providing feedback.
Penalties are imposed on members for lack of participation in voting. Additionally, penalties are applied to the government for failing to address issues promptly.
